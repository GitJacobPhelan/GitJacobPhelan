## Hi there 👋

I am currently a student at Leeds Beckett University studying Software Engineering. But this is not my first time programming; I took IT
and computer science GCSE's in high school and went on to complete a BTEC in Digital Production, Design, and Development.

Programming languages I have studied so far include: Python, HTML, Javascript, SQL, Dart(Flutter), PHP and C.
